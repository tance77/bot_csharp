:conicsonic5 :10/26/2015 7:56:06 PM :she's been seeing a lot of competitive play recently, too!
:conicsonic5 :10/26/2015 7:56:54 PM :nah people are just learning to use her new kit
:conicsonic5 :10/26/2015 7:57:02 PM :since her nerf nobody wanted to play her
:conicsonic5 :10/26/2015 7:57:07 PM :did she really?
:conicsonic5 :10/26/2015 7:57:40 PM :idk if you played at that time @Jchinn but brightwing used to be the most op healer of all time
:conicsonic5 :10/26/2015 7:57:47 PM :so they nerfed the living shit of her to what she is now
:conicsonic5 :10/26/2015 7:57:59 PM :good to know @PixelKatTV!
:conicsonic5 :10/26/2015 7:58:15 PM :her passive is still a little underwhelming
:conicsonic5 :10/26/2015 7:58:39 PM :but a good brightwing player can put out some serious healing numbers
:conicsonic5 :10/26/2015 7:59:38 PM :@Jchinn, that is exactly how she feels
:conicsonic5 :10/26/2015 7:59:48 PM :she feels extremely underwhelming to play
:conicsonic5 :10/26/2015 8:00:00 PM :really need to understand how to use her talents to your advantage
:conicsonic5 :10/26/2015 8:00:17 PM :phase shift shield, passive, and blink heal make her pretty destructive
:conicsonic5 :10/26/2015 8:00:23 PM :just hard to play
